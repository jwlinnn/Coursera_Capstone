    "Car accidents occurs everywhere worldwide and is one of the leading causes for people between the ages 5-29 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO), roughly 1.35 million people die from traffic collisons. More than half of road traffic deaths involve users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Road traffic accidents also attribute to 3% of the domestic product. The goal is to identity relevant factors and derive insight on what events lead to these car accident and what severity is depended on\n",
